INSTALLATION

To build the program, execute

$ python setup.py build

The program must then be installed.  Depending on how Python is installed,
the following may be sufficient:

$ python setup.py install

A system-wide installation generally requires root access:

$ sudo python setup.py install

If you lack root access, or prefer not to affect your Python intallation,
you can install under your home directory as follows:

$ python setup.py install --home /your/home/directory

Your PATH and PYTHONPATH environment variables must then respectively
include the bin and lib/python directories under your home directory.


USAGE

The compat program takes a file in Phylip alignment format (non-interlaced)
or fasta format as input.  It produces one or more output files containing
phylogenetic trees, and writes various information to stderr.

A simple example invocation, using provided sample input, is as follows:

$ compat examples/PDS000002109.4.phy PDS000002109.4.tre

This invocation will create PDS000001546.12.tre, which will contain
a phylogenetic tree in Newick format.

Input files that have been compressed using gzip can also be read:

$ compat examples/PDS000002757.74.phy.gz PDS000002757.74.tre

Input columns with very large numbers of ambiguities ('N' states) can
slow down the algorithm.  These can be excluded from the analysis
with the --max-ambig-frac option, e.g.:

$ compat --max-ambig-frac 0.25 examples/PDS000002757.74.phy.gz PDS000002757.74.tre

ignores columns with greater than 25% ambiguities.

In the examples above, a single tree is produced.  When there is more than
one maximum compatible set, this respresents a consensus.  In addition to this,
a tree for each set may be obtained with the --separate-trees option:

$ compat --separate-trees examples/PDS000002757.74.phy.gz PDS000002757.74.tre

The output file then contains multiple trees: the consensus tree, followed
by a separate tree for each maximum compatible set (in this case a total
of five trees).

Other options:

    --incompat-pos file_name   Writes the positions (1-based indices) of
                               sites that are not in all maximum compatible
                               sets to file file_name, classified accoriding
                               to whether they have >2 nucleotides or, if
			       binary, are absent from all or merely some
                               sets.

    --upper-bounds method      Specify the method used by the maximum weight
                               clique algorithm for finding upper bounds.
                               This can affect the speed of the program.
                               Normally this is chosen by the program, but
                               it can be specified for the purpose of
                               evaluation or perhaps to increase speed in
                               some cases.  Choices for method are 'none',
                               'coloring' (classic use of vertex coloring),
                               or 'dp' (dynamic programming, a novel use
                               of vertex coloring that sometimes provides
                               a great speed advantage).
